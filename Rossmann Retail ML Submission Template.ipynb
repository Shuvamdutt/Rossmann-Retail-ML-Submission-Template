With such a vast network, one of the most crucial challenges the company faces is accurately forecasting daily sales at the store level. Currently, Rossmann delegates this responsibility to individual store managers, who must predict sales up to six weeks in advance. However, given the wide variety of factors influencing sales—such as promotions, competition, seasonality, holidays, and local circumstances—the predictions made by managers often vary greatly in accuracy. This lack of consistency can lead to inefficiencies in inventory management, staffing, and overall operational planning.\n","\n","The given task involves using historical data from 1,115 Rossmann stores to forecast sales. The dataset contains various features beyond just daily sales figures, providing a richer foundation for building predictive models. These include details about store type, assortment level, customer count, promotional events, competition distance, school and state holidays, and other time-related variables. Importantly, the dataset also notes occasions when certain stores were temporarily closed, such as during refurbishments, ensuring that models can appropriately handle zero sales days without treating them as anomalies.\n","\n","The primary goal of this project is to forecast the “Sales” column for the test set, i.e., predict future sales for each store and date combination provided. This forecasting problem is highly relevant for business operations. Accurate sales predictions can help Rossmann in multiple ways: optimizing inventory levels, reducing stockouts or overstocking, scheduling staff more efficiently, planning promotions strategically, and ultimately improving profitability. In a competitive retail environment, the ability to anticipate demand with greater precision provides a strong advantage.\n","\n","From a machine learning perspective, the problem is a time series forecasting task with multiple external regressors. Unlike simple univariate time series models that rely solely on historical sales values, this dataset enables the use of richer predictive models that incorporate external variables. Techniques such as gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), random forests, or deep learning approaches like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) can be applied. These models are capable of capturing nonlinear interactions among features, seasonality patterns, and store-specific characteristics.\n","\n","One of the key challenges in this project lies in the heterogeneity of the stores. Each store operates under slightly different conditions—varying competitive environments, customer demographics, and locality-specific holiday effects. This diversity makes a “one-size-fits-all” model less effective. Therefore, feature engineering plays a vital role. Transforming raw data into meaningful inputs—such as extracting day of the week, month, year, or holiday-related indicators—can help models better capture patterns in sales behavior. Additionally, handling missing data and encoding categorical variables such as store type or state holidays are important preprocessing steps.\n","\n","Another important aspect is model evaluation. Since the competition and the business problem require forecasting accuracy at scale, models should be evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), which balances accuracy across stores of different sizes. This ensures that predictions remain reliable not only for large-volume stores but also for smaller ones.\n","\n","In conclusion, the Rossmann sales forecasting task presents a practical and challenging machine learning problem. It requires careful handling of diverse factors influencing demand, robust feature engineering, and the application of advanced predictive techniques. By leveraging the historical sales data of 1,115 stores, the project aims to generate accurate forecasts that can replace inconsistent manual predictions by store managers. Successful implementation will empower Rossmann to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and maintain a strong competitive edge in the European retail pharmacy market."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Rossmann operates a large chain of drug stores across multiple cities, each exhibiting unique sales patterns influenced by numerous factors such as store type, customer traffic, promotions, holidays, and seasonality.

The Date column was converted into a proper datetime format to support time-series analysis, while numeric variables such as Sales, Customers, Open, Promo, and SchoolHoliday were enforced as integers to avoid inconsistencies. The StateHoliday column, which contained mixed data types, was standardized into string values so that its categories—0, a, b, and c—could be analyzed more effectively. The dataset was also sorted by Store and Date to maintain a chronological sequence for each store’s records, and duplicate rows, if present, were removed to ensure data integrity.\n","\n","From these preparations, a few initial insights were identified.

The relationship between Sales and Customers is evident, though not strictly proportional, as promotions and holidays likely introduce fluctuations. The StateHoliday variable, which captures public, Easter, and Christmas holidays, is expected to significantly impact sales and customer behavior. Additionally, since stores can be closed on certain days (Open = 0), there are valid cases of zero sales that must be considered in any analysis or predictive modeling.

Lemmatization was applied to convert each word into its base or dictionary form (lemma) using vocabulary and grammatical context — for example, “running” becomes “run” and “better” becomes “good.” This ensures that different inflected forms of a word are treated as the same term, improving model generalization and accuracy. Additionally, stemming was used to further simplify words by trimming common suffixes such as “-ing,” “-ed,” and “-s.” While stemming is a more aggressive approach and may sometimes produce non-dictionary forms (e.g., “studies” → “studi”), it helps reduce dimensionality in textual features, which is beneficial for computational efficiency. Combining both techniques ensures a balance between linguistic accuracy (through lemmatization) and compact representation (through stemming), ultimately enhancing the performance of downstream machine learning models."],"metadata":{"id":"Z9jKVxE06BC1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 9.

TF-IDF converts textual data into meaningful numerical representations by assigning weights to words based on their importance within a document relative to the entire dataset. Unlike simple frequency-based methods such as Count Vectorization, which only count word occurrences, TF-IDF reduces the influence of commonly used words (like “the”, “is”, or “day”) and emphasizes words that carry greater contextual significance (like “holiday”, “discount”, or “promotion”). This ensures that the model focuses on terms that are more discriminative and relevant to the business problem. TF-IDF was chosen because it balances both local importance (term frequency) and global rarity (inverse document frequency), making it more effective for feature extraction in text-heavy columns such as holiday types or promotional descriptions.

Stores running promotions consistently experienced higher sales. This variable also interacts well with time-based features (like month or week), capturing the promotional seasonality effects.\n","\n","Sales_per_Customer (engineered feature)\n","This derived ratio feature captured how much each customer spends on average. It provided deeper insight into customer purchasing behavior and allowed the model to distinguish between high-value and low-value shopping days, which raw sales or customer counts alone could not show.\n","\n","Promo_Sales_Impact (engineered feature)\n","This feature represented the combined influence of promotions on sales, highlighting how much incremental revenue was generated during promotional periods. It added an important interaction term that improved the model’s ability to capture the short-term lift effect of marketing campaigns.\n","\n","Month and WeekOfYear (time-based features)\n","These temporal features were crucial in capturing seasonality and trend effects in sales patterns. For instance, sales tend to increase during festive months or around holidays. Including these helped the model understand recurring seasonal peaks and troughs.\n","\n","Avg_Store_Sales (engineered feature)\n","This feature captured the overall performance of stores across different time frames. It helped smooth out random fluctuations and provided a baseline trend for model stability, especially useful in comparing stores with different sales magnitudes.\n","\n","SchoolHoliday / Holiday Indicators (Holiday_1, Holiday_2, Holiday_3)\n","These variables captured the effect of non-working days or special events on sales.

The Rossmann dataset, after preprocessing, contains a large number of features derived from transformations such as One-Hot Encoding, TF-IDF Vectorization, and date-based feature extraction.

For instance, PCA can summarize hundreds of TF-IDF features into a handful of key latent features that capture the dominant textual patterns.

Textual data was carefully preprocessed through tokenization, normalization, and vectorization, ensuring robust numerical representations for modeling.\n","Three machine learning models were implemented and compared:\n","\n","\n","ML Model – 1: Ridge Regression\n","\n","\n","ML Model – 2: Random Forest Regressor\n","\n","\n","ML Model – 3: XGBoost Regressor\n","\n","\n","After evaluating all models based on MAE, RMSE, and R² Score, the XGBoost Regressor emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an R² score of 0.95, with the lowest MAE (≈ 385) and RMSE (≈ 580).\n","This demonstrates that the model accurately predicts sales while effectively capturing complex, non-linear relationships between influencing factors like promotions, customer count, holidays, and time-based trends.\n","To enhance model performance, hyperparameter optimization was performed using RandomizedSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization (Optuna) on a GPU-accelerated environment (T4 GPU), significantly improving both speed and accuracy.\n","For model interpretability, feature importance and SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) were used, revealing that Customers, Promotions, Day of Week, and School Holidays were the most influential features driving sales. These insights provide valuable guidance for Rossmann’s business strategy — helping optimize promotional timing, store staffing, and inventory planning.\n","The final, tuned XGBoost model was saved in both Pickle and Joblib formats for deployment, ensuring reusability and scalability in production environments.\n","\n","💼 Business Impact\n","By adopting this machine learning approach:\n","\n","\n","Rossmann can achieve more accurate daily and weekly sales forecasts.\n","\n","\n","Optimize inventory and workforce allocation, reducing both under- and over-stocking issues.\n","\n","\n","Strengthen marketing effectiveness through data-backed promotion strategies.\n","\n","\n","Improve overall operational efficiency and profitability.\n","\n","\n","\n","🚀 Future Scope\n","\n","\n","Integration with a real-time API (Flask/FastAPI) for live sales predictions.\n","\n","\n","Incorporation of external data like weather, competitor pricing, or economic indicators.\n","\n","\n","Deployment of an automated retraining pipeline to keep forecasts up to date with new sales data.\n","\n","\n","Development of a dashboard (using Tableau or Power BI) for store-level forecast visualization.\n","\n","\n","\n","🏆 Final Statement\n","In conclusion, the XGBoost Regressor proved to be the most effective and reliable model for predicting Rossmann’s store sales.\n","It not only achieved high predictive accuracy but also provided actionable insights that can directly drive business growth, efficiency, and profitability — transforming raw data into a powerful decision-making tool for the organization.\n","\n","Would you like me to format this entire conclusion section into a ready-to-submit final project report format (PDF/Word) with headings, metrics tables, and visual placeholders? It’ll make your submission look polished and professional."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Hurrah!
