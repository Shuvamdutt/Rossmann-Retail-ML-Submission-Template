# Rossmann-Retail-ML-Submission-Template
Rossmann, a leading European drug store chain, operates more than 3,000 retail outlets across seven countries. With such a vast network, one of the most crucial challenges the company faces is accurately forecasting daily sales at the store level. Currently, Rossmann delegates this responsibility to individual store managers, who must predict sales up to six weeks in advance. However, given the wide variety of factors influencing sales—such as promotions, competition, seasonality, holidays, and local circumstances—the predictions made by managers often vary greatly in accuracy. This lack of consistency can lead to inefficiencies in inventory management, staffing, and overall operational planning.

The given task involves using historical data from 1,115 Rossmann stores to forecast sales. The dataset contains various features beyond just daily sales figures, providing a richer foundation for building predictive models. These include details about store type, assortment level, customer count, promotional events, competition distance, school and state holidays, and other time-related variables. Importantly, the dataset also notes occasions when certain stores were temporarily closed, such as during refurbishments, ensuring that models can appropriately handle zero sales days without treating them as anomalies.

The primary goal of this project is to forecast the “Sales” column for the test set, i.e., predict future sales for each store and date combination provided. This forecasting problem is highly relevant for business operations. Accurate sales predictions can help Rossmann in multiple ways: optimizing inventory levels, reducing stockouts or overstocking, scheduling staff more efficiently, planning promotions strategically, and ultimately improving profitability. In a competitive retail environment, the ability to anticipate demand with greater precision provides a strong advantage.

From a machine learning perspective, the problem is a time series forecasting task with multiple external regressors. Unlike simple univariate time series models that rely solely on historical sales values, this dataset enables the use of richer predictive models that incorporate external variables. Techniques such as gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), random forests, or deep learning approaches like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) can be applied. These models are capable of capturing nonlinear interactions among features, seasonality patterns, and store-specific characteristics.

One of the key challenges in this project lies in the heterogeneity of the stores. Each store operates under slightly different conditions—varying competitive environments, customer demographics, and locality-specific holiday effects. This diversity makes a “one-size-fits-all” model less effective. Therefore, feature engineering plays a vital role. Transforming raw data into meaningful inputs—such as extracting day of the week, month, year, or holiday-related indicators—can help models better capture patterns in sales behavior. Additionally, handling missing data and encoding categorical variables such as store type or state holidays are important preprocessing steps.

Another important aspect is model evaluation. Since the competition and the business problem require forecasting accuracy at scale, models should be evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), which balances accuracy across stores of different sizes. This ensures that predictions remain reliable not only for large-volume stores but also for smaller ones.

In conclusion, the Rossmann sales forecasting task presents a practical and challenging machine learning problem. It requires careful handling of diverse factors influencing demand, robust feature engineering, and the application of advanced predictive techniques. By leveraging the historical sales data of 1,115 stores, the project aims to generate accurate forecasts that can replace inconsistent manual predictions by store managers. Successful implementation will empower Rossmann to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and maintain a strong competitive edge in the European retail pharmacy market.
